These tasks don\u2019t require marking, and Emily needs\nto check learners\u2019 submission and completion status. The close time of the\ntasks is coming. Emily can check the submission and completion status of the\ntasks.\n\nLet\u2019s see how Emily will check the task status in Curricula.\n\n#### View learners\u2019 completion status of reference material tasks\n\n1\\. In Curricula, Emily clicks **Result** on the left navigation pane, and\nthen clicks **Tasks**.\n\n2\\. She finds the reference material task \"Classification of Quality\nCharacteristics\" for \"Class A\" and clicks **View details**.\n\n3\\. The reference material is a training video. In the **Learner\u2019s completion\nstatus** section, Emily can view each learner\u2019s completion status, completed\ntime, and total spent time.\n\n#### View learners\u2019 submission status of file submission tasks\n\n1\\. Emily clicks **Result** on the left navigation pane, and then clicks\n**Tasks**.\n\n2\\.

In the **Learner\u2019s submissions** section, Emily can view each learner\u2019s\nsubmission status and submitted time.\n\n4\\. She locates the task of a learner who has submitted and clicks **View\ndetails**.\n\n5\\. On the **View response details****** page, she can check the learner\u2019s\nsubmission details, and then clicks **Next learner** to check the submission\ndetails of the next learner.\n\nThe file submission task is now overdue and some learners haven\u2019t submitted\ntheir tasks. What if Emily wants to extend deadline for them? Let\u2019s see how\nEmily will extend deadline.\n\n#### Extend deadline for learners\n\n1\\. In the **Learner\u2019s submissions** section, Emily can see each learner\u2019s\ndeadline.\n\n\u2022 If Emily wants to extend deadline to the same date for all learners who\nhaven\u2019t submitted their file submissions, she clicks **Extend deadline** and\nselects **Extend deadline for all learners**.\n\n\u2022 If Emily wants to extend different learners\u2019 deadline to different dates,\nshe selects one or more learners, clicks **Extend deadline** , and then\nselects **Extend deadline for the selected learners**.\n\n2\\.
