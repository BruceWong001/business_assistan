Alex is the LMS admin in an organisation and he has been\nassigned as the application admin of Curricula. He would like to view Power BI\nreports. Now let\u2019s see how Alex can generate a Power BI report.\n\n#### First, create a report database connection\n\n1\\. In MaivenPoint Online Services, Alex clicks **Settings** on the left\nnavigation pane, and then clicks **Report database**.\n\n***Note** : The tenant owner or service admin of MaivenPoint Online Services\nhas the permission to create a database connection. If Alex has no permissions\nfor this operation, he can contact their tenant owner or service admin to\nperform it.\n\n2\\. On the **Curricula for Corporate Learning** card, he clicks **Connect\ndatabase**.\n\n3\\. In **Authentication** , there is a default username. Alex needs to click\n**Reset password** to set a password. This set of credentials is used to\ncreate a read-only account in our SQL server to authenticate access to the\nreport data.\n\n4\\. In **Firewall rules** , Alex needs to add an IP address or IP segment.\nOnly the IP addresses added to this field are allowed to access the report\ndata.\n\n5\\. Alex clicks **Save**. The connection details are displayed below. Alex can\nuse the connection details when he retrieves data from the report database\nlater.\n\n***Note** : Data will not be synced from the system to the report database\nimmediately after Alex creates the report database connection. There is a data\nsync job to sync data to the report database, which occurs daily on the hour.\nAlex needs to wait for the next data sync job to complete before he connects\nthe Power BI template to the report database to generate the Power BI report.\n\n#### Second, download a Power BI template\n\nIn Curricula, Alex clicks **Report** on the left navigation pane, and then\nclicks**Download Power BI report Template** on the **Power BI report** card. A\npower BI report template will be downloaded to the default download location\nof his current browser.\n\n#### Third, retrieve data from the report database\n\n1\\. Alex finds the downloaded power BI report template and opens it with Power\nBI Desktop.\n\n2\\. The **SQL Server database** window automatically pops up.\n\nAlternatively, Alex can click **Get data** > **SQL Server** under the **Data**\ngroup to open the **SQL Server database** window.\n\n3\\. Alex completes the SQL server information and clicks **OK**.\n\n4\\. Alex switches to the **Database** tab. He completes user credentials and\nclicks **Connect** to connect to the report database.\n\n5\\. Alex selects all database tables, and then clicks **Load** to load report\ndata.\n\n6\\. When the loading completes, Alex can view the generated Power BI report.\nThis might take a few minutes based on the data size.\n\n7\\. To refresh the report data, Alex clicks **Refresh** in the ribbon.\n\n***Note** : Data in the report database is not collected in real time. There\nis a data sync job to sync data from the system to the report database, which\noccurs daily on the hour. After Alex clicks **Refresh** , the Power BI report\nwill show the data collected by the last data sync job.\n\n", "metadata": {"vec_docs": ["## How to generate a Power BI report?\n\nCurricula provides a Power BI report template to help users visualise data in\nPower BI desktop.
