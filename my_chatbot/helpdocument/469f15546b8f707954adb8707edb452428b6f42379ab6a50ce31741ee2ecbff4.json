When John finishes the configuration for the survey, he clicks **Save**.\n\n6\\. He selects the survey and clicks **Publish**. The learners will see this\nsurvey in their task list and course survey list.\n\n#### Add a survey as a learning object and publish the survey to learners\n\nWhen the survey is ready, John can add it as a learning object to a course.\nLet\u2019s see how John will add a survey as a learning object to a self-paced\ncourse and publish it to learners.\n\n1\\. In Curricula, John clicks **Course** on the left navigation pane, and\nfinds his course.\n\n2\\. John clicks **Configure** and he can see the learning paths that he\nconfigured.\n\n3\\. He locates an existing content group or creates a new one, and then clicks\nthe learning object type**Survey**.\n\n4\\. He fills in the survey information and selects a survey from the survey\nbank. He clicks **Preview survey** to check the corresponding survey content.\n\n5\\. When John finishes the configuration for the survey, he clicks **Save and\npublish**.\n\n#### Check survey results\n\nIf John wants to know how many learners have submitted their responses, he can\ngo to the **Survey** page to check the submission progress for the survey.\nAfter learners have finished submitting their responses, John wants to check\nthe survey results. Let\u2019s see how John will check the survey results for the\ncourse.\n\n1\\. In Curricula, John clicks **Report** on the left navigation pane, and then\nclicks **Survey report**.\n\n2\\. He finds the course \"Certified Quality Engineer\" and clicks the course\nname. He can see the survey name, duration, submission progress, and status of\neach survey in the course.\n\n3\\. John locates the survey that he wants to check and clicks the survey name.\nHe can see an overview of the survey information, questions, and responses.\n\n4\\. He locates a question and clicks **View details** to view each learner\u2019s\nresponse details.\n\n***Note** : John can also click **Export** to export the survey details to an\nExcel file.\n\n", "metadata": {"vec_docs": ["## How to publish surveys and check survey results?\n\nSurvey is a method of gathering information with the aim of collecting\nfeedback from learners.
