It drives and coordinates the implementation of\nthe national SkillsFuture movement, promotes a culture and holistic system of\nlifelong learning through the pursuit of skills mastery, and strengthens the\necosystem of quality education and training in Singapore.\n\nTraining Providers (TPs) receiving funding from SSG are required to adopt a\nTraining Management System (TMS) which is integrated to SkillsFuture\nSingapore's systems. Having a linked TMS will enable seamless data transfer to\nfacilitate SSG training claims processing and it will also allow you as a TP\nto achieve better operational efficiency. Curricula is a TMS from one of the\nqualified TPs.\n\nSSG requires a TMS to synchronise courses, learner enrolment, attendance, and\nassessments to the SSG system. In Curricula, the courses, learner enrolment,\nand assessments can be automatically synchronised to the SSG system. The sync\nof attendance can be manually triggered by trainers.
