He is responsible for preparing courses for trainers and\nlearners.\n\nJoe can create the following types of courses in Curricula:\n\n\u2022 Blended course \u2013 A blended course combines online learning materials and\nopportunities for interaction online with traditional place-based classroom\nmethods.\n\n\u2022 Self-paced course \u2013 A self-paced course allows learners to complete the\ncourse at their own pace.\n\nLet\u2019s see how Joe will create and manage courses in Curricula.\n\n#### Create blended courses\n\nIn Curricula, Joe clicks **Admin** on the left navigation pane, and then\nclicks **Course configuration**.\n\n1\\. In the **Blended courses** tab, he clicks **Create course** and then\nselects **Create course**.\n\n2\\. Joe uploads the course image and fills in the course information.\n\nNote the following:\n\n\u2022 Each course belongs to a programme. Joe can select a previously configured\nprogramme. If he wants to add a new programme, he can navigate to **Programme\nconfigurations** to create a new one.\n\n\u2022 Depending on the course type, the course may require a venue. If a venue is\nrequired, Joe can navigate to **Venue management** to create a venue.\n\n3\\. Joe clicks **Save and release** to save the course and release the course\nto the course manager. If he wants to release the course later, he can click\n**Save**.\n\n#### Create self-paced courses\n\n1\\. In Curricula, Joe clicks **Admin** on the left navigation pane, and then\nclicks **Course configuration**.\n\n2\\. He clicks the **Self-paced courses** tab, clicks **Create course** , and\nthen selects **Create course**.\n\n3\\. Joe uploads the course image and fills in the course information.\n\n***Note** : Each course belongs to a programme. Joe can select a previously\nconfigured programme. If he wants to add a new programme, he can navigate to\n**Programme configurations** to create a new one.\n\n4\\. Joe clicks **Save and release** to save the course and release the course\nto the course manager. If he wants to release the course later, he can click\n**Save**.\n\n#### Enrol learners to courses\n\n1\\. Joe selects the course and clicks **Manage enrolled learners**.\n\n2\\. He clicks **Add learner**.\n\n3\\. In the **Address book** window, Joe can select users or Microsoft Entra\ngroups.\n\n4\\. When Joe finishes the learner enrolment, he clicks **Add**.\n\nWhen the learner enrolment is finished and the course is released, the\nassigned course manager can configure classes, sessions, learning paths, and\nlearning objects for the course. If Joe wants to configure these, he can\nselect the course, click **Configure** , and then refer to the instructions in\nHow to add course content and publish to learners?.\n\n***Note** : When a Microsoft Entra group is enrolled to a course, all existing\ngroup members and newly added group members will be enrolled to the course.\nOnce the course is overdue, Curricula for Corporate Learning will stop syncing\nMicrosoft Entra group members to that course, so that users newly added to the\nMicrosoft Entra group will not be enrolled to the overdue course. If the end\ntime of the course is extended later, Curricula for Corporate Learning will\nsync the user updates during the time period.\n\n#### What if Joe wants to reuse an existing course?\n\nJoe\u2019s organisation provides recurrence courses for different batch of\nlearners. They want to reuse the content of an existing course, so they don\u2019t\nneed to repeat the configurations of classes, sessions, learning paths, etc.\n\nNow let\u2019s see how Joe can duplicate a course in Curricula.\n\n1\\. Joe selects a course and clicks **Duplicate**.\n\n2\\. In the **Duplicate course** panel, Joe can see that the new course will\nuse the same course code and the suffix **\\- Copy** is added to the course\nname. He can modify the course name.\n\n3\\. For a blended course, Joe needs to select the start time and end time for\nthe course. For a self-paced course, Joe can select the end time.\n\n4\\. He selects the **Copy course content to the new course** checkbox.\n\n**Category** |  **What will be copied?** |  **What will not be copied?**  \n---|---|---  \nBlended course |  Classes, including class owners |  Learners in classes  \nSessions, including trainers |  Session time  \nLearning paths |  Topics in discussion forum  \nContent groups |  Surveys  \nLearning objects, including markers |  Settings  \nFiles in staff workbin  \nSelf-paced course |  Learning objects, including markers |  Learners  \nSettings  \nTopics in discussion forum  \n  \n5\\.
